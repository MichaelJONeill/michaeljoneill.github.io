I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From 2020 to 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Lehigh University, where I was funded by a Computing Innovation Fellowship. Prior to joining Lehigh, I completed my PhD at the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2020.
