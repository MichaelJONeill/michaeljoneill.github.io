I am an assistant professor in the [Statistics and Operations Research Department](https://stor.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/).

I obtained my PhD in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2020 where I was advised by Stephen J. Wright. Afterwards, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at Lehigh University from 2020 to 2022.

My research interests lie in the design, analysis and implementation of continuous, nonlinear optimization methods.
