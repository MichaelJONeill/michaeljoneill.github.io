## Overview

This course is designed to introduce the foundations of optimization to graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, especially to students at the STOR department. It aims at conveying the most common theoretical elements and methods for graduate students who pursue research and career in different disciplines such as operations research, statistics, machine learning, computer science, engineering, applied math, and data science. The course covers both classical and modern topics from the basic to advanced theory and numerical methods. It starts from common mathematical models: linear programming and quadratic programming and moves to unconstrained convex minimization, nonconvex optimization, and then stochastic optimization. As usual, the background theory of convex optimization is convex sets, convex functions, and theory of polyhedra, which will be formally introduced in this course. Simplex methods, gradient descent algorithms, and Newton schemes that form the foundations of numerical optimization will also be presented in this course. Common models such as LASSO, logistic regression, portfolio optimization, and empirical risk minimization will be used as representative examples during the course. Recent advanced methods such as fast gradient, proximal-based, and stochastic gradient algorithms with variance reduction and adaptive learning rates will be discussed. In addition to theory and algorithms, common optimization modeling software and computer solvers will also be introduced to students.

## Prerequisites

This course requires basic background on numerical linear algebra and some parts of multivariable calculus such as basic topology (e.g., open, closed sets, limits, continuity, derivatives, etc.), gradients, and Hessian of multivariable functions. Students are recommended to take MATH547/MATH577 or an equivalent (e.g., STOR 415) prior to taking this course.
