## Overview

This course will provide a detailed and deep treatment for commonly used methods in continuous optimization, with applications in machine learning, statistics, data science, operations research, among others. The main focus of this course is on continuous optimization algorithms and as well as some core optimization theory as a foundation for the development of these algorithms. The discussions of algorithms will be accompanied with representative applications.
